<h1>Welcome!</h1>
<p>This is the personal website of Dr. Alyn Gamble, an information professional currently based in Boston, Massachusetts. I am non-binary and use they series pronouns.

  <p>
In my research, I focus on the information behaviors of sexual and gender minority individuals pursuing remission from substance use disorder. My other investigations have focused on queering information behavior research, the impact of stigma on health information-seeking behavior, and the use of AI chatbots in mobile applications for mental health.

I am the STEM Librarian at Northeastern University and an affiliated faculty member in the Writing, Literature, and Publishing Department at Emerson College. My professional background includes work in digital publishing, information literacy, and scholarly communications, as well as developing digital repositories. I've also conducted research and provided instruction in digital humanities and research data management.

<p>
When away from screens, I enjoy running, bicycling, birdwatching, reading, performing improv comedy, and attending concerts and theatrical productions.
